        Dealing with files
    </h1>

    <p>
        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. 
        When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure on 
        your local computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking 
        right before you eventually <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Publishing_your_website" 
        target="_blank">upload them to a server.</a> <em>Dealing with files</em> discusses some issues you 
        should be aware of so you can set up a sensible file structure for your website.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>
        What structure should your website have?
    </strong></h2>

    <p>
        Next, let's look at what structure our test site should have. The most common things we'll have 
        on any website project we create are an index HTML file and folders to contain images, style files, 
        and script files. Let's create these now:<br>
        <pre>
        index.html: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that 
        people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor, create a new file called index.html 
        and save it just inside your test-site folder.<br>
        images folder: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder.<br> 
        styles folder: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style your content (for example, setting text and background colors). 
        Create a folder called styles, inside your test-site folder. <br> 
        scripts folder: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). Create a folder called scripts, inside your test-site folder.
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>
        Where should your website live on your computer?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        When you are working on a website locally on your computer, you should keep all the related files in a single 
        folder that mirrors the published website's file structure on the server. This folder can live anywhere you like, 
        but you should put it somewhere where you can easily find it, maybe on your Desktop, in your Home folder, or at the 
        root of your hard drive.
    </p>

    <p>
   <pre>
    Choose a place to store your website projects. Inside your chosen place, create a new folder called web-projects (or similar). This is where all your website projects will <br>
    Inside this first folder, create another folder to store your first website in. Call it test-site (or something more imaginative).</pre>

        An aside on casing and spacing
    </h3>
    
    <p>
    <pre>
        You'll notice that throughout this article, we ask you to name folders and files completely in lowercase with no spaces. This is because:
        Many computers, particularly web servers, are case-sensitive. So for example, if you put an image on your website at test-site/MyImage.jpg and then in a different file you try to invoke the image as test-site/myimage.jpg, it may not work. <br>
        There are many ways in which using spaces in file names create issues: <br>
        When you invoke commands in the terminal, you have to put quotes around file names with spaces in them, or the path will be interpreted as two separate items. <br>
        Some programming languages (e.g. Python) do not work well with spaces in file names if these files are modules to be imported.
