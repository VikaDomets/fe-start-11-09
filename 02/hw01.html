    HTML basics
    </h1>

    <p>
    <em><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong></em> is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
    content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. 
    As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
    </p>

    <h2><em>So what is HTML?</em></h2>
    <p>
        HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you 
        use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing 
        tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. 
        For example, take the following line of content:</p>
        <pre>My cat is very grumpy</pre>
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

    <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and 
        closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins. <br>
        <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash 
        before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing
        tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results. <br>
        <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text. <br>
        <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
